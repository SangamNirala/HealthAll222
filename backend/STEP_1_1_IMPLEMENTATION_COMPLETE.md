## ðŸ“‹ **REQUIRED EXAMPLES - ALL WORKING PERFECTLY**

| **Input Example** | **Expected Output** | **Actual Output** | **Status** |
|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|------------|
| `"i having fever 2 days"` | `"I have been having a fever for 2 days"` | `"I have been having a fever for 2 days"` | âœ… **PERFECT** |
| `"me chest hurt when breath"` | `"My chest hurts when I breathe"` | `"My chest hurts when I breathe"` | âœ… **PERFECT** |
| `"haedache really bad"` | `"Headache really bad"` | `"Headache really bad"` | âœ… **PERFECT** |
| `"stomach ache n vomiting"` | `"Stomach ache and vomiting"` | `"Stomach ache and vomiting"` | âœ… **PERFECT** |

## ðŸŽ¨ **ADVANCED FEATURES IMPLEMENTED**

### **Grammar Pattern Corrections**
- **Subject-verb agreement**: `"i having" â†’ "I have been having"`
- **Temporal corrections**: `"fever 2 days" â†’ "fever for 2 days"`
- **Pronoun fixes**: `"me chest hurt" â†’ "my chest hurts"`
- **Contextual grammar**: `"when breath" â†’ "when I breathe"`

### **Medical Spelling Corrections**
- `"haedache" â†’ "headache"`
- `"cheast" â†’ "chest"`
- `"stomache" â†’ "stomach"`
- `"diabetis" â†’ "diabetes"`
- `"preassure" â†’ "pressure"`

### **Abbreviation & Informal Language**
- `" n " â†’ " and "`
- `" 2 " â†’ " for "` (contextual)
- `" w/ " â†’ " with "`
- `"cant" â†’ "cannot"`
- `"tummy" â†’ "stomach"`

### **Medical Context Preservation**
- Maintains medical terminology accuracy
- Preserves symptom descriptions and temporal information
- Keeps urgency and severity indicators intact
- Protects numerical medical data (blood pressure, pain scales)

### **Processing Pipeline**

```
Patient Input â†’ Text Normalization â†’ Medical AI Processing â†’ Response Generation
     â†“                    â†“                    â†“                      â†“
"i having fever"    "I have been      Medical Entity        Professional
"2 days"           having a fever     Extraction &          Medical
                   for 2 days"        Emergency Detection   Response
```

## ðŸ“Š **PERFORMANCE METRICS**
