# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:

COMPREHENSIVE TESTING RESULTS: (1) Complete 5-step assessment wizard functions perfectly through all steps (age selection, activity level, health goals, dietary preferences, stress level), (2) Final button click now successfully triggers processAssessment function with proper console logging, (3) API call to POST /api/guest/health-assessment executes successfully with 200 response, (4) Results page displays correctly showing health score 67, health age 46, personalized recommendations, and meal suggestions, (5) No JavaScript errors detected, (6) Full end-to-end functionality restored. The user-reported issue has been completely resolved and the health assessment feature is now fully operational."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

(2) Backend API Integration: ✅ PASS - Patient Queue API endpoint (/api/provider/patient-queue/provider-123) called successfully, real-time data displayed including queue statistics (12 in queue, 3 urgent, 8 scheduled, 8 completed, 18 minutes avg wait), priority queue with patient details and vitals, scheduled appointments with room assignments. (3) UI Functionality: ✅ PASS - Tab navigation working (Patient Queue/All Patients), search functionality operational, filter dropdown functional, patient table displays correctly with 4 patients, action buttons present (See Now, Start Visit, Message, Reschedule). (4) Mobile Responsiveness: ✅ PASS - Interface adapts correctly to mobile viewport (390x844), maintains functionality and readability. (5) Advanced Features Present: ✅ PASS - Priority queue with urgent cases, vitals data display (HR, BP, TEMP, GLUCOSE), room assignments (ER-3, Room 2, Room 5), wait time tracking, patient status indicators.

PATIENT NAVIGATION: ✅ Food Log working perfectly (loads dedicated page with full functionality), ❌ Health Metrics navigation fails (button clicks but page doesn't load properly), ❌ Goals navigation fails (Goals button not found in navigation). GUEST NAVIGATION: ✅ Food Log working perfectly (loads dedicated page with full functionality), ✅ Nutrition Tips working perfectly (loads dedicated page with comprehensive tips). PROVIDER NAVIGATION: ✅ Patients working (loads patient management page), ✅ Clinical Tools working (loads tools page), ✅ Analytics working (loads practice analytics page). SMARTNAVIGATION COMPONENT: ✅ Role-aware theming working (different colors for each role), ✅ Navigation items are clickable and functional, ✅ All dedicated page components load correctly with proper content. The main issues reported by user ('food log, health metrics and more button is not working' and 'food log and nutrition tips button is not working') are PARTIALLY RESOLVED - Food Log buttons work for both Patient and Guest roles, but Patient Health Metrics still has issues. Overall navigation system is functional with minor issues on Patient Health Metrics."
