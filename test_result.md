TESTING SCOPE COMPLETED: (1) ❌ Phase 3 Contextual Analysis Endpoint: FAILED (0/3 scenarios passed) - All 3 ultra-challenging scenarios failed validation with processing times 64.7ms average (exceeds 25ms target by 158%), missing expected contextual factors in all scenarios, coherence score 1.000 meets target but contextual factor detection completely failed. (2) ❌ Performance Issues: CRITICAL - Average processing time 64.7ms exceeds 25ms target by 158%, needs immediate optimization of contextual pattern processing. (3) ❌ Contextual Factor Detection: FAILED - Expected contextual factors missing in all 3 scenarios (positional_factors, temporal_factors, environmental_factors, activity_relationships), need enhancement of factor population logic. (4) ✅ Medical Coherence: TARGET MET - 1.000 vs target >0.97, but meaningless without proper contextual factor detection. (5) ❌ Causal Accuracy: NEEDS ASSESSMENT - Cannot properly assess with missing contextual factors, requires better causal relationship detection and validation.

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

(3) ✅ CONTEXTUAL REASONING ACTIVATION FIXED: Enhanced all consultation stage handlers (_handle_greeting_stage, _handle_hpi_stage, _handle_ros_stage) to include contextual reasoning data extraction using AdvancedSymptomRecognizer.extract_medical_entities and include Step 2.2 fields in all responses. (4) ✅ INTELLIGENT RESPONSE GENERATION: Added _generate_contextual_greeting_response method that creates contextually intelligent responses based on causal relationships, clinical hypotheses, and contextual significance rather than generic messages. Prioritizes contextual patterns over basic symptoms. (5) ✅ ULTRA-CHALLENGING SCENARIO HANDLING: Enhanced greeting stage handler to properly detect and process complex medical patterns with causal relationships (positional/orthostatic, exertional/cardiac, dietary/digestive contexts) and generate appropriate clinical reasoning responses. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS: All stage handlers now extract contextual reasoning from patient messages, include comprehensive Step 2.2 fields in API responses, use contextual intelligence for response generation, and provide clinical reasoning narratives. System now processes contextual symptoms instead of falling back to generic 'please describe symptoms' messages. EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS: Ultra-challenging scenarios should now achieve 100% success rate with proper contextual analysis, API responses include all required contextual reasoning features, consultation flow uses contextual intelligence throughout, emergency/urgent detection enhanced with contextual significance assessment. Ready for comprehensive backend testing to validate Step 2.2 Context-Aware Medical Reasoning Engine fixes."
